# Death Head Hopper VR Bridge

Add VR support, through RepoXR, to DeathHeadHopper mod 2.1.8.

## How it works
- Camera control is detached from the movement joystick and tied to the grip of the corresponding controller so you can aim jumps without turning the viewpoint.
- To activate the ability, hold the left grip and press the `VR Actions/ResetHeight` action (Quest binding used in the current feature flags).
- This bridge is developed and tested on Meta Quest, so bindings may differ on other headsets and should be verified.

Install alongside Cronchy's DeathHeadHopper 2.1.8 and the RepoXR dependencies to enjoy the VR experience.

## Quick note
Treat it like an alpha prototype :)
it could glitches so in case just call it a feature and keep hopping xD
